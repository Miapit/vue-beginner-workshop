## Chapter 4

### Target

In this fourth chapter we will learn about methods and computed properties.

Methods in Vue.js allow for the creation of a cleaner and dryer code. Logic gets moved away from components to dedicated methods,
making templates clean and readable, while all the logic is kept in one easy to read place.

### Challenges

1. Transform the `@click` expression to a method.
2. Change the click handler toggle the `dropdown` on/off.
3. Transform the visibility check on the `members` div to a `isVisible` method.
